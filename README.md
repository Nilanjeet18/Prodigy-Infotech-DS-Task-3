# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 3:

Welcome to my submission for Task 3 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Tools and Libraries used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

2. **Visualization**: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. 


## Conclusion

In conclusion, Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
